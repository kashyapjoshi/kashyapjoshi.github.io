Hi! Iâ€™m Kashyap, an electronics enthusiast and [assistant professor](https://engineering.nmims.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-profile/kashyap-joshi/) at the Department of Electronics & Telecommunications at [MPSTME NMIMS](https://engineering.nmims.edu/). I have completed my M.Tech in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering from MPSTME, NMIMS University and stood second in my class. I have a particular focus on robotics, circuit design & their open-source software outlets.

Most of my previous industrial work was centred around dial making softwares, panel meter manufacturing & their circuitry at [Rishabh Instruments Pvt. Ltd](https://rishabh.co.in/).

At NMIMS, I have been teaching subjects like Digital Logic Design, Analog Electronics, Numerical methods, Microprocessor and Microcontrollers and Optical Fiber Systems for the past 5 years. I have also mentored student teams at various robotics competitions.
