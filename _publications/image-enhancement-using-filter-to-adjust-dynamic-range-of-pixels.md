excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for image enhancement in compressed (DCT) domain. Despite, few
algorithms have been reported to enhance images in DCT domain proposed algorithm differs from previous
algorithms in such a way that it enhances both dark and bright regions of an image equally well. In addition, it
outperforms in enhancing the chromatic components as well as luminance components. Since the algorithm
works in DCT domain, computational complexity is reduced reasonably.'
